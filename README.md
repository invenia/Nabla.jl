Nabla.jl is a reverse-mode automatic differentiation package targetting machine learning use cases.
As such, we have (for example) prioritised support for linear algebra optimisations and higher-order functions over the ability to take higher-order derivatives (Nabla currently only supports first-order derivatives).

The [latest docs](https://invenia.github.io/Nabla.jl/latest/), and code in the [examples](examples) folder, best indicate how to use the package.
Given the early stage of development, we anticipate a number of bugs and performance issues.
If you encounter any of these or have any particular feature requests, please raise an issue and let us know.
